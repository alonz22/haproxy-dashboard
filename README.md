## HAProxy Configurator - v1.3.3
### Disclaimer
This HAProxy Configurator is a tool to assist in generating configurations for HAProxy, a powerful and widely used open-source load balancer and proxy server. It is intended to simplify the process of creating HAProxy configurations for specific use cases.
This HAProxy Configurator is not affiliated with, endorsed, or maintained by the HAProxy project. HAProxy is a registered trademark of its respective owners.

## Description
The HAProxy Configurator provides a user-friendly web interface where users can input their desired configuration parameters, such as frontend and backend settings, backend servers, load balancing methods, health checks, sticky sessions, SSL certificates, ACLs, and more. The tool then generates the corresponding HAProxy configuration file based on the provided inputs.

Important Notes
This tool is intended to be used as an aid in generating HAProxy configurations and to make the process more accessible and efficient. However, it does not replace or outperform HAProxy's built-in functionality or configuration capabilities.

While we strive to ensure the accuracy and correctness of the generated configurations, it is essential to review the resulting configuration file carefully before deploying it in production environments. The user is responsible for thoroughly testing and verifying the configuration for their specific use case.

## Requirements
Before using the HAProxy Configurator, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

1.A user with high privileges (sudo or root).

2.HAProxy: HAProxy must be installed on your system. The configurator relies on HAProxy to manage load balancing and proxying. Please install HAProxy using the package manager for your specific OS.

3.Python 3: The HAProxy Configurator is implemented in Python 3. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system to run the configurator.

4.Port 5000 Available: The configurator runs as a web application and listens on port 5000. Ensure that port 5000 is available and not occupied by any other process.

## Install:

1. clone the repository:
   ```git clone https://github.com/alonz22/HAProxy-Configurator```

2. Install pip (if not installed already):

- for ubuntu:
  ```apt install python3-pip```
  
- RedHat:
  ```yum install python3-pip```

3. Install flask and the app dependencies by simply run the Makefile in the cli:
   ```make install```
   
4. enter the root folder of the app:
   ```cd haproxy-configurator```

5. run the installation script:
   ```chmod +x install.sh```
if the script failes to run with "bad interpreter" error, run the following:
   - ```sed -i 's/\r//' install.sh```
   - ```./install.sh```

6. the path of the root directory of the app should be located now at ```/etc/haproxy-configurator```

7. run ```service haproxy-configurator status``` to see if the service is running.


8.browse the app:
   ```browse https://your-haproxy-server-ip:5000```

## SSL Certificate

The application comes with a self signed certificate related to tthe domain "haproxy-configurator.local". The path to the PEM file can be changed inside ssl.ini configuration file.

## Usage
Launch the HAProxy Configurator by navigating to https://your-haproxy-server-ip:5000.

Fill in the required parameters and options for your HAProxy configuration.

## Roadmap Overview
### Phase 1: User Experience Enhancements
1.Dark Mode: Introduce a sleek and comfortable dark mode interface, providing an alternative visual style for users who prefer reduced screen brightness during prolonged usage.

### Phase 2: Performance and Flexibility

1.HTTP Keep-Alive Option: Implement an option to enable HTTP Keep-Alive within the frontend configurations. This feature enhances connection efficiency by allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single TCP connection.

2.Backup Servers for Backend: Enhance backend resilience by adding support for specifying backup servers. These servers will be used when the primary servers are unavailable, improving overall service availability.

3.Dynamic Backend Server Addition: Introduce an intuitive button to dynamically add backend servers directly from the GUI, eliminating the need to manually edit configuration files.

### Phase 3: Optimizations and Security

1.Frontend Caching Mechanism: Implement a frontend caching mechanism to optimize content delivery and reduce backend load. This feature will help accelerate user experiences and decrease response times.

2.Advanced WAF Protection: Bolster our existing WAF features with a more robust and comprehensive set of protections against emerging threats. Enhancements will include:

* Advanced SQL injection detection and prevention
* Enhanced XSS attack mitigation
* Fine-grained controls for blocking sensitive data leaks
* Improved anomaly detection for DOS attacks
